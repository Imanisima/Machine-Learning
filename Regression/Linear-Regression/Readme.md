## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Introduction to Linear Regression :chart_with_upwards_trend:
When considering Linear Regression, we want to predict approximately an outcome (Y) using some variables (X). We want to describe a relationship between two or more variables.

You can ask yourself, "Given this dataset, can we predict Y using X"?

``` Example: Given this dataset, can we predict **CO2 Emissions** of a car using **Engine size and Fuel Consumption**? ```

We want to predict CO2 Emissions of a car (Y) using some variables (X).

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Types of Linear Regression :chart_with_upwards_trend:
This folder will include the following types of Linear Regression:
 - Simple Regression: One independent variable is used to estimate one dependent variable.
 
 ```Example: Predict CO2 emissions using the engine size of the car.```

 - Multiple Regression: Multiple independent variables are used to estimate the dependent variable.
 
 ```Example: Predict CO2 emissions using both the engine size and cylindar type of the car. ```

### :bell: Terms :bell:
(Y) Dependent Variable: 
* The outcome / What we're testing for
* Continuous values only

(X) Independent Variable: 
* Independent: Does not rely on other variables
* Categorical or Continuous
